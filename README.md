# Adventures of Cactusman
You ARE the weapon.  Made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 32 (April 2015), this is a weird roguelike about being a cactus in a dungeon.  Your goal is to go as far into the dungeon as possible, and follow the magical radio.

Controls:

 * WASD to move
 * RMB to fire a cactus spine at where your mouse is pointing (requires 1 SP)
 * Space to do a quick-heal, with strength equal to your level (requires 2 SP)

You can walk over a chest to open it, then take whatever item is inside with the button in the lower left.  Swap Shops are like chests, except they have 3 possible item choices instead of one.

See how long you can survive!
